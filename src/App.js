<h3>Limited Collection </h3>
<p>
Only <strong id="mint-date">7000</strong> Pixel Cowboys will ever be minted. Each cowboy will be unique and randomly 
        generated by code. 
</p>
<h3>Fair Minting</h3>
<p id="about-p">
        We want to reward early adopters. Because of this, we will have a <strong>FREE MINT</strong> for the early gunslingers in the community.
        After <strong>25%</strong> minted, the price will be open to the public for a fair price of <strong>0.025 ETH</strong>.
        This is because the community is what's important, not the revenue from the minting. 
      </p>
<h3>Community Driven</h3>
<p id="about-p">
        The cowboys have each others back. We believe that the <strong id="mint-date">Pixel Cowboys 
        community</strong> knows what's best for the future of the cowboys. This means that all the changes in the project
        runs through every cowboy as they has a saying.

        <h3>25 % Minted üöÄ</h3>
        <p>The early supporters of the Pixel Cowboys Community Club will be rewarded with a <strong>FREE</strong> mint. This is because our vision is to build a <strong>community driven</strong> project where revenue is secondary and community comes first.
            After 1750 cowboys has been minted, we will start <strong>airdropping</strong> tokens and NFTs to the early holders. </p> 

        <h3>50 % Minted üöÄ</h3>

        <p>When 50% is reached, a <strong>BIG ETH giveaway</strong> will take place. We dont believe in one holder winning a massive price, but instead we want to give this to 
          20 cowboy holders, making your chance greater to win some of the ETH. Along with this, we will also giveaway <strong>5 Pixel Cowboys NFTs</strong> to 5 cowboy holders.</p>

        
          <h3>100%  Minted üöÄ</h3>

        <p>After all the cowboys has been minted, a <strong>MEGA ETH giveaway</strong> will occur. This giveaway will be distributed to 50 % of the cowboy holders, making the 
          chances for each holder to win ¬Ω. We believe that this is the best way to do it, as we want as many as possible in the community to benefit from 
          the giveaways. We will also giveaway <strong>10 Pixel Cowboys NFTs</strong> to 10 cowboy holders. After this, a new road map will be developed - <strong>ROAD MAP 2.0</strong></p>
